      <description>I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin studying Pure Mathematics and Neuroscience. I am interested in efficiency, probability, languages, and weightlifting.
I initially created this blog as as a way to share my thoughts and projects.
I enjoy reading&amp;ndash; anything &amp;ndash; fiction, non-fiction, nutrition labels. Some particular topics that I enjoy to read about are: mysteries, comedy, fiction, philosophy amongst other thing.
You can see what I am currently or going to read through my goodreads account.</description>
