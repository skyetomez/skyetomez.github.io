<h1>Bee colony collapse: Causes and Solutions survey</h1> 

<h2 id="summary-and-motivation">Summary and Motivation</h2>
<p><em>This was written in 2018 as part of course on being green and renewable energy sources in modern times. During this time, bee colonies were collapsing and caused a huge scare in the USA especially in the almond industry.</em></p>
<p>Apis mellifera (honeybee) are one of the most studied insects in the world due to their crucial role as a
pollinator of almost 85% of North American and European crops. Prior to 2013, Colony Collapse Disorder
(CCD) was a new and dangerous phenomena causing wide spread hive loss which directly impacted the
pollination of agricultural products that relied on honeybees as pollinators. Through a concerted research
effort, many possible causes of CCD were discovered such as: the Nosema gut pathogen, Apocephalus
Borealis (phorid fly), and neonicotinoids. The most prominent cause was reported to be the Varroa
destructor mite which was introduced from the Eurasian Continent. New research suggests a possible
pesticide that systemically kills the Varroa mite while not affecting A. mellifera mortality rate.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the winter of 2006 to 2007 there were large-scale losses of managed honeybee colonies in the United
States and Europe [1]. The losses were not new to industry, however both the scale and speed at which
they occurred caused the pollination and beekeeping industry alarm. These losses were characterized
by some portion of the dead and dying hives by: rapid loss of adult worker bees, weak colonies with
excess offspring, a large lack of dead workers bee within and near the hive, and a delayed invasion of
hive pests [1].
Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is the phenomenon that occurs when the majority of worker bees
in a colony disappear and leave behind a queen, plenty of food and a few nurse bees to care for the
remaining immature bees and the queen [2]. Despite the drop in reported cases since 2013 [2], CCD is
important to study as more than 80% of agricultural crops in the world are pollinated by Apis mellifera
(honeybees) [3]. Many flowering crops such as the Prunus dulcis rely heavily on bees for pollination
and to produce fruit [4]. Furthermore, the magnitude and speed of hive losses prior to 2013 appeared
to be unprecedented and cost both the agricultural and beekeeping industries billions [4].
CCD is a complex phenomenon with symptoms at many ecological levels. Indeed, in studies concerning CCD-affected bee populations, it is suggested that CCD involves an interaction between pathogens
and other stress factors [1]. Additionally, research demonstrates that the condition is contagious [1]. This is significant because of the pollination industry involves the mixing of honeybee populations from
all over North America [4].
There are many possible causes of honeybee CCD which, prior to 2013, was the main cause of
honeybee death in both North America and Europe. Possible causes that led to the mass disappearance
of bees include: phenomena caused by traditional bee pests, diseases, agrochemisty and agricultural
production, and poor apiary management1 [3]. Other causes include: narrowing of genetic variability of
queen bees, poor bee nutrition, lack of flowers, or the growing and use of genetically modified crops [3].
However, the problem is a complex one and may be a combination of all or some of the above factors
and factors not mentioned [1].</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<h3 id="pests-of-honeybees">Pests of honeybees</h3>
<h4 id="1-varroa-destructor">1. Varroa destructor</h4>
<p>The Varroa destructor (Varroa mite) is a parasite that attaches onto A. mellifera and leave their larvae
to feed. This parasite is not indigenous to North America and was transported from the Eurasian conti-
nent. As a result of not being indigenous, North American A. mellifera (Apis mellifera) are particularly
susceptible to the parasite. Furthermore, the parasite is a vector of the deformed wing virus (DWV) [5].
It is this combination of stressors that were a major contributor to the losses of A. mellifera colonies in
North America and in Europe [6].
There have been at least three cases reported of A. mellifera colonies surviving the parasitic infection
by means of natural selection in Europe [7]. In study to determine whether the difference in the
population of A. mellifera that survived the infestation was due to adult grooming of larvae or removing
the infected, it was found that neither of these behaviours were significantly different between bee
colonies that survived the infestation and bee colonies that did not survive. The study concluded that
there are efficient mechanisms in place by natural selection to protect bee colonies over time [7].</p>
<h4 id="2-apocephalus-borealis">2. Apocephalus Borealis</h4>
<p>The Apocephalus Borealis (phorid fly) lays eggs in the abdomen of a A. mellifera by their ovipoistors.
Once infected, A. mellifera act oddly, foraging at night and gathering around lights like moths. During
1Apiary management is the set of routine activities in an apiary depending on weather or seasonal changes and the
initial objectives of set up this period, the eggs hatch and begin to eat A. mellifera from the inside. Parasitized A. mellifera show
hive abandonment behavior, leaving their hives at night and dying shortly thereafter. Once dead, A.
borealis fly larvae then emerge from the neck of the bee decapitating it. In contrast to V. destructor, A.
borealis are native to North America, but have only recently been found to infect A. mellifera perviously
only been known to infect bumblebees and other bee specieces [8].
In 2011, widespread parasitism by the A. borealis on A. mellifera was found in the San Francisco
Bay Area with 77% of the sample sites (24 of 31) in the San Francisco Bay Area being parasitized by A.
borealis [8]. It was further found, with an average infection rate of 25% over 6 months, that A. borealis
could spread inside the hive after an initial infection along with the potential to infect and kill a queen.
Additionally, infected A. mellifera were often found to be infected with DWV and Nosema ceranae [8].</p>
<h3 id="new-or-emerging-diseases">New or Emerging Diseases</h3>
<h4 id="1-nosema">1. Nosema</h4>
<p>The pathogen Nosema spp. is an endoparasitic infection of A. mellifera which adversely affects honeybee
colony health and can lead to the collapse of a colony. In particular, autumn infections can lead to poor
overwinter performance, the main indicator of hive health. Historically, Nosema disease was thought to
be caused by the gut parasite Nosema apis, however, a recent survey of historical samples collected from
across the U.S. suggests that N. apis has been largely displaced by N. ceranae which was transferred
from its original host to A. mellifera [9]. Further implication can be seen in that N. ceranae has been
present in large-scale losses experienced by Spanish beekeepers. [10] In an experiment, it was found that
of 630 bees, 147 or 23.3% of A. mellifera in a sample had become infected after being fed Nosema spores
after being exposed to pesticides. That is, Nosema have demonstrated an increased rate of infection
with pesticide exposure [11].</p>
<h3 id="pesticides-or-agrochemicals">Pesticides or Agrochemicals</h3>
<h4 id="1-neonicotinoids">1. Neonicotinoids</h4>
<p>Neonicotinoids have high selectivity towards invertebrate over vertebrate organisms. Being largely
aliphatic, they are taken up systemically and can spread to all plant tissues, which makes them an
efficient insecticide when applied in small quantities. At the same time, several of the neonicotinoid
compounds have been shown to be highly toxic to A. mellifera in very small quantities [12]. By a
meta-analysis, it was found that there was a positive correlation between the lethal toxicity of pesticides for A. mellifera. This has been extrapolated beyond only honeybees to other bee species [12].</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>With respect to threats to North American A. mellifera, the Varroa destructor mite appears to be the
most harmful to colony health overall. The Varroa mite is widespread in North American honeybee hives,
and the Varroa mite affects A. mellifera at all stages of their life cycle. Additionally, they are vectors
of the broken wing virus. As a result, United States beekeepers rank the Varroa mite parasite as a
threat more dangerous than that of CCD [13]. Indeed, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
reported the number of hives lost due to CCD has dropped since 2013 and beehives failing over winter
due to factors other than CCD [2]. During the 2014-2015 year period, losses of managed honeybee
colonies were 23.1% in winter, but summer losses were much higher during this period at 42.1%. This is
important because winter losses were traditionally considered a more important indicator of bee colony
health [13]. These losses were heavily attributed to beekeepers not taking appropriate steps to control
mites [13]. In sum, the more immediate problem to North American A. mellifera are Varroa mite and
protecting honeybees from them [8].
The above reason motivates the search for Varroa mite specific pesticides. A promising solution is
the use of lithium chloride (LiCl) which has been demonstrated to kill Varroa mite effectively and is
taken up systemically by Varroa mite . The administration of LiCl is lethal at 25mM, but between 2mM
and 25mM concentrations of LiCl have a clear effect on the viability of Varroa mite with between 10mM
and 25mM concentrations having a significant enhancement on the mortaility the of Varroa mite [14].
Despite finding that LiCl was effective at at killing the Varroa mite , it is also important to consider
the possible effects on the mortality of A. mellifera also exposed to similar concentrations before possible
adaptation of LiCl as a Varroa mite pesticide. On worker bees, there is no statistically significant effect
of mortality after exposure to 2mM, 10mM or 25mM concentrations of LiCl. In fact, there exists a good
tolerablity of LiCl in bees [14]. This accounts for the short term exposure to LiCl on A. mellifera . In
the long term, LiCl appears to impede the viability of bees only if administered continuously over an
extended period of time. That is, LiCl has potential to work as a Varroa mite pesticide if administered
acutely at peak mite periods and not administered continuously as a way of prevention.
This technique has at least one clear positive and negative effect. A drawback to this technique is
that it requires active hive monitoring in order at assess what the Varroa mite population concentration
and the A. mellifera population concentration are in order to decide whether to administer LiCl. An advantage of this technique is that it would make Varroa mite immunity due to natural selection less
likely in the short run as the mites are not being continuously exposed to LiCl. This would allow the
use of LiCl as a Varroa mite pesticide over the long-run.</p>
