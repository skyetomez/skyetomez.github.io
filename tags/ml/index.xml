      <description>Summary Sounds are cool because they’re just a type of signal. Signals are often better understood in their spectrogram form. All of this information can be used by a neural network to learn something. In this case, it learns to identify a word (either a yes or no) by its spectrogram.
All code is available on my github or the colab notebook here
Background and Motivation I’ve been interested in machine learning and neural networks since my exposure to it during a computational neuroscience class.</description>
