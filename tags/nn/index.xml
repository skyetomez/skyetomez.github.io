      <description>Summary Sounds are cool because they’re just a type of signal. Signals are often better understood in their spectrogram form. All of this information can be used by a neural network to learn something. In this case, it learns to identify a word (either a yes or no) by its spectrogram.
All code is available on my github or the colab notebook here
