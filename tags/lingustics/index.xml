      <description>When I was growing up, I was always deeply interested in languages. I learned some Russian, Italian, Mandarin, and Spanish. During this time, I would occasionally hear the word ‘critical period’ which refers to the hypothesis that prior to a certain time during childhood, a language can be learned to native proficiency and without effort given only input from a more knowledgeable other. From my own experience as a language learner, I believe this as well.</description>
