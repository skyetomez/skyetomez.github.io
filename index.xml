      <description>Summary Sounds are cool because they’re just a type of signal. Signals are often better understood in their spectrogram form. All of this information can be used by a neural network to learn something. In this case, it learns to identify a word (either a yes or no) by its spectrogram.
All code is available on my github or the colab notebook here
Background and Motivation I’ve been interested in machine learning and neural networks since my exposure to it during a computational neuroscience class.</description>

      <description>Find all functions $x(t),~y(t)$ satisfying $$x&#39;(t) = y(t) - x(t)$$ $$y&#39;(t) = 3x(t) - 3y(t) $$. Find the Particular pair of functions satisfying $x(0)=y(0)=1/2$
Solution :
We solve this by eliminating variables.
  Find the function $f(n), n = 0,1,&amp;hellip;,10$ that satisfies \begin{equation*} f(n) = \frac{1}{4}f(n-1)+\frac{3}{4}f(n+1), n=1,2,..,9, \end{equation*} and $f(0)=0,~f(1)=1$.
Solution :
  The Fibonacci numbers $F_n$ are defined by $F_1=1,~F_2=1$ and for $n&amp;gt;2$, $F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$. Find a formula for $F_n$ by solving the difference equation.</description>

      <description>1 Summary and Background This was written in 2018 as part of course on being green and renewable energy sources in modern times.
A new revolutionary genome-editing tool called CRISPR has been and continues to change the landscape of genetics and bioengineering. In borrowing this selective and programmable bacteria/archaea defense system, scientists have been able to do things such as: prevent heart disease at the level of the human embryo and develop test strips for field medical diagnostics.</description>

      <description>Summary and Background This was written in 2018 as part of course on being green and renewable energy sources in modern times.
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from the U.S. department of agriculture are mostly from studied from transportation, industry, and electricity generation despite the fundamental importance of agriculture, forestry and other land usage (AFOLU) . Little has been done until recent decades to understand the impact on climate change by this sector in America and moreover the world.</description>

      <description>Summary and Motivation This was written in 2018 as part of course on being green and renewable energy sources in modern times. During this time, bee colonies were collapsing and caused a huge scare in the USA especially in the almond industry.
Apis mellifera (honeybee) are one of the most studied insects in the world due to their crucial role as a pollinator of almost 85% of North American and European crops.</description>

      <description>Summary The motivation for this mini-project was to not only get more familiar with working with $\tt{pygame}$ but also to give myself a playground that I could hook into other packages like $\tt{networkx}$. I also wanted to practice generating fractals. While looking over old notes, I came across the rules for a random process that looked interesting to visualize and potential to become fractal-like.

      <description>When I was growing up, I was always deeply interested in languages. I learned some Russian, Italian, Mandarin, and Spanish. During this time, I would occasionally hear the word ‘critical period’ which refers to the hypothesis that prior to a certain time during childhood, a language can be learned to native proficiency and without effort given only input from a more knowledgeable other. From my own experience as a language learner, I believe this as well.</description>

      <description>Summary My friend was wondering about if there were enough climbing centers per city depending on how many people lived in the city and here is my rudimentary attempt to try to answer that question without anything fancy.  Introduction This project was started as a joint project between a friend that enjoys climbing and myself. He pointed out that he was convinced that the number of climbing centers in our city corresponded with it’s size.</description>

      <description>The following was written in response to a class biochemistry dicussion post.
Kizzy did an amazing job making vaccine efficacy easy to understand when she showed that it is just the number of people of the got sick with the placebo compared to the total number of people that got sick. In other words, it&amp;rsquo;s a percentage that hides a ratio.
I found this interesting because if 18/20 is the the vaccine efficacy, then 20-18 is the number of people who got sick with the vaccine.</description>

      <description>The following was written in response to a class biochemistry dicussion post.
PHK2 is an important enzyme in the regulation of blood sugar levels as it responds to the peptide hormones insulin and glucagon that are both released by the pancreas.
I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen the enzyme phosphofructokinase-2 (PHK2) and for 2 principle reasons: (1) I find this enzyme interesting because of how it differs from phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) in that it has a much lower affinity (greater K_m) for the same substrate glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) than PFK1 [1].</description>

The cofactor vitamin K is not only known for its importance in the process of blood coagulation, rather it is also recognized for its ubiquity in photosynthesis as well.
I learned about this vitamin in a rather uneventful mundane way. I was reading a book (or something) about something and the use of the drug dicoumarol to deplete vitamin K storage was being used to illustrate something else.</description>
