\title{Quadratic Polynomials} \author{Skyler} \date{November 2016}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section*{Exercises} \begin{enumerate}
\item[1.] Let $p(t)=at^2+bt+c$ be a quadratic polynomial. \begin{enumerate} \item[(a)] Show that $p(t)$ can be written in the form $$a(t+\frac{b}{2a})^2-\frac{1}{4a}(b^2-4ac).$$ It is not immediate that $p(t)$ can be realised in the desired form, but by working backwards the strategy becomes apparent.\hfill\break First we note that $$p(t)=at^2+bt+c=at^2+bt+\frac{b^2}{4a}-\frac{b^2}{4a}+c.$$ Next, by algebra, $$a(t^2+\frac{b}{a}t+\frac{b^2}{4a^2})-\frac{1}{4a}(b^2-4ac).$$ But, $$a(t^2+\frac{b}{2a}t+\frac{b}{2a}t+\frac{b^2}{4a^2})-\frac{1}{4a}(b^2-4ac).$$ Finally,$$p(t)=a(t+\frac{b}{2a})^2-\frac{1}{4a}(b^2-4ac).$$ As was to be shown.</description>
