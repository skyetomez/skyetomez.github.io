      <description>I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin studying Pure Mathematics and Neuroscience. I am interested in efficiency, probability, languages, and weightlifiting.  I initially created this blog as as a way to share my thoughts and projects.  I enjoy reading-- anything -- fiction, non-fiction, nutrition labels. Some particular topics that I enjoy to read about are: mysteries, comedy, fiction, philosophy amonst other things. You can see what I am currently or going to read through my goodreads  account.</description>
